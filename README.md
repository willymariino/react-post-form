## Project Overview
This project is a React-based application built with Vite, designed to explore the concept of multi-field forms.  
It allows users to create posts by filling out a form with multiple fields, submit the data via an HTTP POST request to an external API using Axios, and then display the submitted posts directly on the page.

## Features
- **Multi-Field Form:** Users can input an author, title, body, and select a public/private status.
- **API Integration:** Form data is sent to a mock REST API via Axios POST requests.
- **Postman Verification:** The API was tested with Postman to confirm data integrity and successful storage.
- **Real-Time Display:** Submitted posts are immediately rendered on the page after submission.
- **React Hooks:** Utilizes `useState` to manage form and post data efficiently.
